// javascript is executed by a javascript engine built into web browsers
// for example v8 in chrome and spidermonkey in firefox

// it is called node

// Difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript
// ECMAScript is just a Specification, JavaScript is a programming language that 
// confirms to this specification.
// ECMA is an organisation which defines standards for ECMAScript.
